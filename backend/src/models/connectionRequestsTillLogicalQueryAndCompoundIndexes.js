      //!the type of this status is string,because it is a string at the end of the day.But this enum will define that what values are accepted in the form of string.Apart from that no value will be accepted.This is kind of like a schema level validation.

//?What is this pre method and when this will be called?This is kind of like a middleware,it will be called everytime,the connectionRequest document will be saved onto our database.Any time you are saving the connectionRequest.whenever you will call a save() method.whenever you will call this save() method over here.So it will be called pre save.That is why the name is pre.This pre means that I am calling this middleware pre save.This "save" here is basically kind of like an event.It is kind of like a event handler.Before I save the document this function will be called.So you can basically do a lot of validations as well as check over here.
